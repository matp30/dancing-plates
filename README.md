# (New) Dancing Plates

This was the final project for my beginner programming class in college. It's a remake of the Atari 2600 game "Dishaster", with addded features, using the Allegro5 library.

## How to Install

Start by installing Allegro5.
```bash
apt-get install liballegro5-dev
```
Run the following command to generate a game file:
```bash
make
```
Finally, run the game with:
```bash
./tp
```

## How to Play

Move the player character with the W and A keys. Don't let the spinning plates fall! Stabilize them with the S key, or catch them in midair if need be. When a plate hits the ground, you lose.
