# (New) Dancing Plates

This was the final project for my first semester programming class in college. It's a remake of the Atari 2600 game "Dishaster", with addded features, using the Allegro5 library.

## How to Install

Start by installing the Allegro 5 library.
```bash
apt-get install liballegro5-dev
```
Run the following command to generate a game file:
```bash
make
```
Finally, run the game with:
```bash
./tp
```
