# (New) Dancing Plates

This was the final project for my beginner programming class in college. It's a remake of the Atari 2600 game "Dishaster", with addded features, using the Allegro5 library.

Move the player character with the W and A keys. Don't let the spinning plates fall! Stabilize them with the S key, or catch them in midair if need be. When a plate hits the ground, you lose.
